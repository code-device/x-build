X-BUILD is a scaffolding tool for small projects. It can quickly initialize the project directory in a few seconds through terminal commands, and solve the problems of automation, performance, modularity, specification, adaptive layout, etc. in development, and help you generate better code. It consists of two parts: a project generator based on the Node.js environment, which is an NPM package installed in the global environment, and a webpack-based development and production environment that configures various requirements.
